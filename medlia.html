                <p> Medlia app is a product focused on improving communication between patients and doctors or medical
                    specialists. It makes viable for the user to talk with them from anywhere in the world using
                    internet connection. The platform also offers a few more possibilities that completes its function
                    to become a great tool when traveling. It shows all the medical centers around based on users
                    location and keeps it up with news related to health care and medical industry. </p>

                <h3 class="mt-50">We wanted the most useful medical platform for uncomfortable situations.</h3>
                <p>Since the start of the briefing process the objective was to think of a tool that would improve
                    communication with doctors in some specific scenarios which had clear pain points identified
                    from
                    users insights. Those scenarios implied traveling, recovering process where the patients
                    couldn’t
                    move, and emergency medical consultations. </p>
                <p>As an UX designer, I had to understand very well the context we were working with. To be able to
                    achieve this knowledge we had to make an exhaustive research based on interviews for both
                    patients
                    and doctors, and the administration of the medical centers as well. </p>

                <h3 class="mt-50">User persona</h3>
                <p>To be always aware of the direction of the platform, we made 4 types of user persona based on his
                    needs. Since we extracted a few scenarios which had been identified as pain points, this users
                    would
                    be very helpful to make the thinking process more specific and orientated.

                <h3 class="mt-50">Challenge</h3>
                <p><b>Don’t break the law! </b><br>
                    Since the application had to move confidential information we had to be very conscious on what
                    we
                    could do and what we couldn’t. For example, in Spain exists both private and public medical
                    assistance, and each one has different levels of restriction. Since public centers are more
                    strict,
                    we couldn’t offer them all the services we wanted in the first place.

                <h3 class="mt-50">Visualizing the MVP</h3>
                <p>The first step in the kickoff process was to identify how our MVP should be. This made us think on which were the most valuable functions of the platform and if those were achievable on the first kickoff. We agreed that making contact with the doctor was the main function the platform had to have. In first place, we wanted it to be able to make video calls where the doctor could see the patient and be able to gather more valuable information. But the developing process was taking more time that we expected. So we decided to launch a first approximation with a traditional call system and an in-app chat where the user could talk with the doctor and sent pictures if necessary.

                <h3 class="mt-50">Never stop iterating</h3>
                <p>Designing solutions always implies iteration until we feel it has perfectly accomplished the goals. Iterations are powered by feedback. You make something, get new perspective, and try again. Again and again. This feedback is a lot more valuable when comes from it’s final user targets so we made a closed prerelease which allowed us to test the most reliable way we could possibly do at the moment for a great first kickoff

                <h3 class="mt-50">Things i’ve learned from Medlia App project</h3>
                <p><b>To prioritize experience over features </b> <br>
                    A startup means you have to make hard calls. You have to decide what to cut out to ship on time. We learnt this balance (while still sticking to quality). It worked well because people responded to our difference in quality.</p>                    
                    <p><b>To not be too attached to an idea. </b> <br>                  
                    The ideas constantly change based on the insights. We have to make sure that we are not obfuscated with an idea that is not objectively estructured. 
                    </p>
                    <p> <b>Start small and quickly</b> <br>                 
                    The idea here is to start receiving feedback as soon as possible. Every idea is great in the head who conceive it. Face that idea with its final users it’s, I believe, the only way to see the reality of it’s value.
